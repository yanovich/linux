512kB battery backed up SRAM on LP-8x4x industrial computers

Required properties:
- compatible : should be "icpdas,sram-lp8x4x"

- reg: physical base addresses and region lengths of
       * IO memory range
       * SRAM page selector

SRAM chip is connected via FPGA and is not accessible without a driver,
unlike flash memory which is wired to CPU MMU. Driver is essentially
an address translation routine.

Example:

	sram@a000 {
		compatible = "icpdas,sram-lp8x4x";
		reg = <0xa000 0x1000
		       0x901e 0x1>;
	};
