LP-8x4x is an ARM-based industrial computer with a custom parallel bus to
connect expansion modules with digital input/output, analog input/output,
serial, CAN and other types of ports.

The bus is implemented by a FPGA. There are two major groups of expansion
modules: serial and parallel.

Serial modules (I-870xxW series) implement DCON protocol which allows one-
master-many-slaves configuration over RS-485. When these modules are installed
into the device, they could be accessed using the 2nd PXA built-in UART port
(/dev/ttyS1). However, it seems that addresses are not processed by
the modules. So the parallel bus needs to select which slot is connected.

Parallel modules allow much faster communication. There are accessed using
IO memory through the FPGA. Their ports are exposed via sysfs.

SYSFS
-----

/sys/bus/icpdas/devices/backplane:

active_slot
	RW - connects the select slot for serial communications. If there
	     is a parallel module in the selected slot, it simply ignores
	     incoming packets. So it is safe to activate any available
	     slot.

dip
	RO - shows status of LP-8x4x 8bit DIP switch

eeprom_write_enable
	RW - controls write access to board's EEPROM (1 - enable)

rotary
	RO - shows position of LP-8x4x rotary switch (0-9)

slot_count
	RO - shows total number of expansion slots on the device

/sys/bus/icpdas/devices/slot%02i:

model
	RO - shows expansion module model number

output_status
	RW - set status of digital output channels on the module in
	     the expansion slot. Value can be read back.
